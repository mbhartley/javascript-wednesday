EXAMPLE 1 is rickyBobby. It contains some personal information about rickyBobby that you can 
call up by prompting rickyBobby to:

first: rickyBobby.giveAddress
second: rickyBobby.giveFullAddress
third: rickyBobby.quoteFavoritePrayer

rickyBobby will return his best answers to these requests!


EXAMPLE 2 is heyEinstein. Einstein will tell you the number of hydrogen atoms per water molecules when you prompt 

heyEinstein.countHydrogen

I'm not completely pleased with this one when its run multiple times b/c Einstein's variables
are limited by the simplicity of my formula!


EXAMPLE 3 is masonEats. It tells Mason how much he will weigh after eating donuts vs. after
eating kale. Basically, he gains 5lbs when he eats donuts, and loses 2lbs when he eats kale. So, you can run it every time he eats one or the other, and it will keep a live tally of his current weight. Try:

masonEats.donuts
or
masonEats.kale


Enjoy!
